# Private Access Modifier - By definition, Private members of a class (variables or methods) are those members which are only accessible inside the class. We cannot use private members outside of class.

# Name mangling - Name mangling in Python is a technique used to protect class-private and superclass-private attributes from being accidentally overwritten by subclasses. Names of class-private and superclass-private attributes are transformed by the addition of a single leading underscore and a double leading underscore respectively.

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._nonmangled_attribute = "I am a nonmangled attribute"
        self.__mangled_attribute = "I am a mangled attribute"

my_object = MyClass()

print(my_object._nonmangled_attribute) # Output: I am a nonmangled attribute
# print(my_object.__mangled_attribute) # Throws an AttributeError
print(my_object._MyClass__mangled_attribute) # Output: I am a mangled attribute
